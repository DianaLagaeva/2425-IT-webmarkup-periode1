                        <h2>Fats: Essential Fuel for Energy and Vital Functions</h2>
                        <p>Fats are often misunderstood, but they play an essential role in your diet, particularly for those with an active lifestyle. Far from being something to avoid, healthy fats are crucial for providing long-lasting energy, supporting brain function, and regulating hormones. Including the right types of fats in your diet can help boost performance and overall health.</p>

                        <h2>What Are Fats?</h2>
                        <p>Fats are a macronutrient, like protein and carbohydrates, that provide your body with energy. In fact, fats are the most calorie-dense macronutrient, supplying 9 calories per gram compared to 4 calories per gram from carbs or protein. Beyond energy, fats are essential for cell structure, hormone production, and absorbing fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Sustained Energy: Fats provide a steady source of energy, especially during longer-duration, low-intensity activities.</li>
                            <li>Brain Function: Your brain is composed largely of fat, and healthy fats are necessary for optimal cognitive function.</li>
                            <li>Hormone Regulation: Fats are involved in the production of hormones like testosterone and estrogen, which are important for muscle building, recovery, and overall well-being.</li>

                        <h2>How Much Fat Do You Need?</h2>
                        <p>The amount of fat you need depends on your total daily calorie intake, activity level, and health goals. Here’s a simple formula to estimate your daily fat intake:</p>
                        <h3>Fat Intake Formula:</h3>
                        <h4>1.Find your weight in kilograms (kg):</h4>
                        <p>If you know your weight in pounds (lbs), divide it by 2.2 to convert to kilograms.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: 165 lbs &div; 2.2 = 75 kg</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>2.Calculate your total daily calorie needs:</h4>
                        <p>To estimate how many calories you need each day, multiply your weight (in kg) by an activity factor:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sedentary (little to no exercise): Weight (kg) × 25</li>
                            <li>Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week): Weight (kg) × 30</li>
                            <li>Moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week): Weight (kg) × 35</li>
                            <li>Very active (hard exercise 6-7 days/week): Weight (kg) × 40</li>
                            <li>Example: A moderately active person weighing 75 kg would need approximately 75 × 35 = 2,625 calories per day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>3.Determine your fat intake:</h4>
                        <p>Fats should make up 20-35% of your total daily calories. Multiply your total calories by the appropriate percentage to get your daily fat requirement, and divide by 9 (since fats provide 9 calories per gram).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <br>2,625 calories × 0.25 (25% fat) = 656 calories from fat.<br>656 calories ÷ 9 = 73 grams of fat per day.</li>
                        </ul>
