                        <h1>What is NutriCalc?</h1>

                        <p>
                            NutriCalc is an all-in-one tool that helps you understand and calculate your daily nutrient needs based on your personal goals and activity level. Nutrition is the foundation of any active lifestyle, but with so much contradictory information out there, it’s hard to know what, how, and how much you should eat. That’s where we come in.

                        <p>
                            At NutriCalc, we focus on the four essential components of a healthy diet:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Protein: The building block for muscle growth and recovery.</li>
                            <li>Carbohydrates: The primary source of energy to fuel your workouts and daily activities.</li>
                            <li>Fats: Crucial for energy, brain function, and hormone regulation.</li>
                            <li>Fiber: Essential for digestive health and long-term well-being.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Each of these plays a key role in supporting your performance, recovery, and overall health. <br>Our website offers personalized calculators and expert-backed insights to help you understand how much of each you need based on your body, lifestyle, and fitness goals.
